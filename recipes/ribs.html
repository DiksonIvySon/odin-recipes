    <h2>Oven-Baked Ribs</h2>
    <p>You're craving ribs, but don't have access to a grill. 
        Heartbreaking, we know, but that's where these BBQ 
        oven-baked ribs come in. Now, you can make tender, 
        fall-of-the-bone ribs in the comfort of your own 
        kitchen, no matter the time of year or your living 
        situation. Sweet, salty AND savory, these ribs are 
        perfect to serve up for any game day celebration or 
        weeknight dinner. Tip: The last thing you'll want to 
        do is run out before everyone gets their fair share, 
        so make sure you have at least 4-5 ribs per adult, 
        which is about 2-3 servings per rack. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lb. baby back ribs</li>
        <li>1/2 c. packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. garlic powder </li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. ground mustard</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. cayenne</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 300Â° and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. 
            If your ribs have a thin membrane over the bones on the backside, 
            remove by carefully sliding a knife under membrane and then peel 
            it away.
        </li>
        <li>In a small bowl stir together brown sugar, salt, garlic powder, 
            pepper, paprika, mustard powder, and cayenne. Rub mixture all 
            over ribs and place on prepared baking sheet. Cover with foil 
            and bake until very tender, 2 hours. 
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile make barbecue sauce: In a medium saucepan over medium 
            heat, combine all sauce ingredients together. Bring to a boil, 
            then reduce heat and let simmer, stirring occasionally, until 
            thickened, 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>Turn oven to broil. Remove foil from ribs and brush both sides 
            with barbecue sauce. Broil until sauce just starts to caramelize, 
            2 to 4 minutes.
        </li>
        
    </ol>
