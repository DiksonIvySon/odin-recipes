    <h2>The Best Homemade Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to 
        feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It 
        freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you 
        happy for days. Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me 
        his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking 
        since his college days. Alton's original recipe created 
        enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is 
        posted here will easily serve eight people.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>tomato sauce</li>
        <li>noodles</li>
        <li>cheese</li>
        <li>meat</li>
        <li>peppers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, 
            and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. 
            The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
        </li>
        <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. 
            We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the 
            mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
        </li>
        <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer 
            of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until 
            you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
